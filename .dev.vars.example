# Cloudflare Environment Variables (Local Development)
# Copy this file to .dev.vars and fill in your values
# .dev.vars is gitignored and will not be committed

# Available when running:
# - pnpm dev (Next.js dev server with Cloudflare bindings)
# - pnpm preview (local Cloudflare preview)

# All environment variables here are accessible via getCloudflareContext()
# in your Next.js app. For production, use: pnpm wrangler secret put <KEY_NAME>

# Example environment variables:
# API_KEY=your-api-key-here
# STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
# DATABASE_URL=your-database-url

# Public variables (exposed to browser - use sparingly):
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com

# Note: Unlike traditional Next.js, you don't need separate .env.local
# All env vars go here and are accessible server-side via Cloudflare env
