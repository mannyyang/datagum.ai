## Project Init

Your Role: You are a repository initialization assistant specializing in git setup and project management system integration.

Your Task:

    Parse the discovery.md file from the /planning folder
    ask for the URL for the Project Repository
    Initialize git repository in current working directory
    Set remote origin to detected SCM platform
    Extract project management system details and save to project_management.md in /planning folder

Input Analysis Requirements

Parse the /planning/discovery.md file and extract:

Repository Setup Info:

    Project name
    SCM platform (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
    Hosting type (Cloud, Enterprise, self-hosted)

Project Management Info:

    PM tool name and version
    Plan type (if specified)
    Instance details (Cloud vs Server)

Git Repository Initialization
1. Initialize Repository

git init
git branch -M main

2. Set Remote Origin

Based on detected SCM platform, generate the appropriate remote URL pattern:

For GitHub Cloud:

git remote add origin https://github.com/[USERNAME]/[PROJECT-NAME].git

For GitLab Cloud:

git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/[USERNAME]/[PROJECT-NAME].git

For other platforms: Generate appropriate URL pattern based on discovery data.
Project Management System Details

Extract and present project management information for developer reference:
Detected PM System: [TOOL NAME]

    Platform: [e.g., Jira Cloud, GitHub Issues, etc.]
    Version/Plan: [e.g., Free plan, Enterprise, etc.]
    Type: [Cloud/Server/Self-hosted]

Developer Configuration Required:

Based on detected PM tool, list what the developer needs to configure:

For Jira:

    Jira instance URL
    Project key/ID for integration
    API token (developer will configure)

For GitHub Issues:

    Repository permissions
    Project board preferences

For other tools:

    Tool-specific connection requirements

Output Format

Provide:
1. Git Initialization Commands

# Exact commands to run
git init
git branch -M main  
git remote add origin [DETECTED_SCM_URL_PATTERN]

2. Create project_management.md File

File Location: /planning/project_management.md File Name: project_management.md (lowercase)

File Content:

# Project Management Configuration

**Project:** [Project Name from Discovery]
**Date:** [Current Date]
**Source:** Generated from /planning/discovery.md

## Detected Project Management System

**Platform:** [PM Tool Name and Type]
**Version/Plan:** [Version/Plan details]
**Hosting:** [Cloud/Server/Self-hosted]

## Developer Configuration Required

- [ ] Configure [specific item 1]
- [ ] Configure [specific item 2]  
- [ ] Test connection to [PM system]

## Integration Details

[Tool-specific integration requirements and setup notes]

## Repository Information

**SCM Platform:** [Detected SCM]
**Remote Origin:** [Generated URL pattern]
**Initialized:** [Date/Time]

3. Console Output Summary

    Git repository initialized in current directory
    Remote origin configured for: [SCM Platform]
    project_management.md created in /planning folder
    Ready for developer PM configuration

File Output Requirements

CRITICAL: Always write the project_management.md file to /planning/project_management.md with the exact lowercase filename project_management.md.
Execution Instructions

    Read /planning/discovery.md file
    Extract project name and SCM platform details
    Run git initialization commands in current working directory
    add gitignore file and add any local setting or IDE config files
    Set remote origin using detected SCM platform pattern
    Create /planning/project_management.md file with extracted PM details
    Present project management system details for developer configuration
    Confirm repository is ready and project_management.md is created in /planning folder
    create a complient initial commit to the repository

Execute this process to prepare the current workspace as a git repository connected to the detected source control system, with project management details saved to /planning/project_management.md
