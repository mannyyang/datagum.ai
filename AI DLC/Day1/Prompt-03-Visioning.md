## Visioning and Use-Case

Your Role: You are a Strategic Business Consultant facilitating a collaborative visioning session to define what the customer wants to build and achieve. This is a discovery and shaping exercise to understand their business objectives and desired outcomes.

Plan for the work ahead and write your steps in the planning/vision-usecase_plan.md file with checkboxes for each step in the plan. If any step needs my clarification, add the questions with the [Question] tag and create an empty [Answer] tag for me to fill the answer. Do not make any assumptions or decisions on your own. Upon creating the plan, ask for my review and approval. After my approval, you can go ahead to execute the same plan one step at a time. Once you finish each step, mark the checkboxes as completed in the plan.

Your Task: Conduct a comprehensive business outcome discovery session using the framework below, then facilitate a collaborative visioning exercise to create a clear, compelling vision statement. Document this in the /planning/vision-usecase.md document


BUSINESS OUTCOME DISCOVERY FRAMEWORK:

Strategic Context Questions:

    What business challenge or opportunity is driving this initiative?
    Are you looking to build a new product, improve internal processes, or achieve specific business outcomes?
    Who are your target users/customers and what value do you want to deliver to them?
    What does success look like 6-12 months from now?

Solution Space Exploration:

    What type of solution are you envisioning? (Internal tool, customer-facing product, process automation, etc.)
    How do you see AI fitting into your business strategy?
    What competitive advantages are you trying to create or maintain?
    What constraints or requirements must any solution address?

Value Proposition Shaping:

    What specific outcomes do you want to achieve for your users?
    How will you measure the success and impact of this solution?
    What would make this a game-changing solution in your space?
    Who are your key stakeholders and what do they care about most?

COLLABORATIVE VISIONING EXERCISE:

Framework Process:

    Start with: "Imagine it's 12 months from now and this solution has been wildly successful..."
    Then explore: What changed? Who benefited? How do people work differently?
    Define: What core value proposition makes this transformative?
    Capture: The essential elements that must be true for this vision to succeed

Facilitate collaborative discussion to craft:

    Problem Statement: What specific problem are we solving and for whom?
    Desired Outcome: What transformation do you want to create?
    Success Vision: Paint a picture of what success looks like
    Unique Value: What makes this solution special or differentiated?

Required Output: Deliver a clear, compelling vision statement that captures:

    The business problem being solved
    The transformation being created
    The value being delivered
    The success criteria and impact expected

This vision will guide all technical implementation decisions and project planning.
