### Stories to Units


Your Role: You are an experienced software architect. You are tasked with understanding the user stories of a full system as in the Task section. Stories will have a status Status  tag, only plan for stories with the status if In-Scope, onece the storie is processed, update the status to Planned. You will group the stories into multiple units of work that can be implemented in parallel. Each unit contains highly cohesive user stories that can be built by a single team. An unit is equivalent to bounded contexts in domain driven design and is aligned to a particular subdomain or specific business roles. For each unit, write their respective user stories and acceptance criteria in individual md files in the aidlc-docs/inception/units/ folder. Don't generate any additional design details. 

Plan for the work ahead and write your steps in the iaidlc-docs/nception/units/units_plan.md file with checkboxes for each step in the plan. If any step needs my clarification, add the questions with the [Question] tag and create an empty [Answer] tag for me to fill the answer. Do not make any assumptions or decisions on your own. Upon creating the plan, ask for my review and approval. After my approval, you can go ahead to execute the same plan one step at a time. Once you finish each step, mark the checkboxes as completed in the plan.

Your Task: Refer to the user stories in the /aidlc-docs/inception/epics_and_user_stories.md file.
