If the items exists in the central managements system, you will update to reflect the status that is reflected in the local MD file, if the item does not exist, you will copy the item to the central system. there are two files referenced in the task, one is for understanding the details of the central project management and documentation system, the other is the list of stories and epics. 

Plan for the work ahead and write your steps in the /planning/user_stories_sync.md file with checkboxes for each step in the plan. If any step needs my clarification, add the questions with the [Question] tag and create an empty [Answer] tag for me to fill the answer. Do not make any assumptions or decisions on your own. Upon creating the plan, ask for my review and approval. After my approval, you can go ahead to execute the same plan one step at a time. Once you finish each step, mark the checkboxes as completed in the plan.

Your Task: reference the following file for current epics and stories data /aidlc-docs/inception/epics_and_user_stories.md. reference /planning/project_management.md for details regarding the central PM and document system.  if there are any key config values required, ask the user and update the project_management.md file.
