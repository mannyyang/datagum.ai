### Domain Modelling

Done by each team for a specific unit - not that the file refernce to the unit MUST be updated as well as the output name but keeping in the naming standard defined above

Your Role: You are an experienced software engineer. You are tasked with
designing the Domain Model to implement all the user stories as referred in the
Task section. This model shall contain all the components, the attributes, the
behaviours and how the components interact to implement business logic in the
user stories. Do not generate any architectural components. Do not generate any
codes. Write the component model into a separate md file in the
aidlc-docs/construction folder using the same name as the file mentioned in the
task, you MUST add the prefix model_ to generated file.

Plan for the work ahead and write your steps in the aidlc-docs/construction/U8_infrastructure_devops.md file with checkboxes for each step in the plan. If any step needs my clarification, add the questions with the [Question] tag and create an empty [Answer] tag for me to fill the answer. Do not make any assumptions or decisions on your own. Upon creating the plan, ask for my review and approval. After my approval, you can go ahead to execute the same plan one step at a time. Once you finish each step, mark the checkboxes as completed in the plan.

Your Task: Refer to the user stories in the planning/units/U8_infrastructure_devops.md
as you complete work, makesure to ALWAYS update the planning/epics_and_user_stories.md file with epic and story status of in-progress
